# Lab 12 - Using the ipconfig Command

## Objective
Use the `ipconfig /all` command to identify and correct an incorrect IP configuration on a PC.

## Scenario
A small business owner is unable to connect to the Internet from one of the four PCs in the office. All PCs are configured with static IP addressing using the 192.168.1.0/24 network. Each PC should be able to access the web server at www.cisco.pka. The goal is to use the `ipconfig /all` command to identify which PC has an incorrect configuration.

## Steps Performed
1. Accessed the command prompt on each PC and executed `ipconfig /all`.
2. Verified the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway settings for each PC.
3. Noted the configuration details to identify the misconfigured PC.
4. Selected the incorrectly configured PC and navigated to Desktop > IP Configuration.
5. Corrected the IP settings to match the expected configuration for the network.

## Summary of Learnings
This lab helped me understand how to:
- Use the `ipconfig /all` command to inspect detailed network configuration.
- Identify discrepancies in IP settings that prevent network connectivity.
- Correct static IP configurations to ensure proper access to network resources.
- Troubleshoot basic connectivity issues in a local network environment.
