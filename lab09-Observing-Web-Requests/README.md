# Lab 09 - Observing Web Requests

## Objectives
- Visualize client/server traffic sent from a PC to a Web server when requesting web services.

## Instructions

### Verify connectivity with the Web server
1. Click on **External Client** and access the **Command Prompt** from the Desktop tab.
2. Use the ping command to reach the URL `ciscolearn.web.com`:

PC> ping ciscolearn.web.com

3. Notice that the IP address appears in the ping output. The IP is obtained via the DNS server that resolves the domain name. All network traffic uses the source and destination IP information.
4. Close the Command Prompt window, but leave the External Client desktop open.

### Connect to the Web server
1. In the Desktop window, open the **Web Browser**.
2. Enter `ciscolearn.web.com` in the URL field.
3. Read the displayed web page and leave it open.
4. Minimize the External Client window without closing it.

### View the HTML code
1. In the logical topology, click on the `ciscolearn.web.com` server.
2. Go to **Services > HTTP** tab. Next to `index.html`, click **Edit**.
3. Compare the HTML markup on the server with the page displayed on the External Client browser. (You may need to maximize the External Client window if it was minimized.)
4. Close the Web server and External Client windows.

### Observe traffic between client and Web server
1. Enter **Simulation Mode** by clicking the Simulation tab at the bottom right.
2. Double-click the **Simulation Panel** to detach it and view the full network topology.
3. Filter traffic to visualize only TCP and HTTP:
- Click **Edit Filters**
- In the **Misc** tab, make sure only **TCP** and **HTTP** are selected.
4. Add a **Complex PDU**:
- Click the open envelope above the Simulation Mode icon.
- Select **External Client** as the source.
- In **PDU Settings > Select Application**, choose **HTTP**.
- Select `ciscolearn.web.com` as the destination.
- Enter **1000** as the Starting Source Port.
- In **Simulation Settings**, choose **Periodic Interval** and enter **120 seconds**.
- Click **Create PDU**.
5. Play the simulation and observe the traffic flow. Speed up the animation using the slider.
6. When **Buffer Full** appears, click **View Previous Events**.
7. Review the **Event List** to see the number of packets sent. HTTP is a TCP protocol, which requires connection establishment and acknowledgment, increasing network traffic overhead.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned 
- Learned how DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- Observed the sequence of HTTP requests and responses between a client and a Web server.
- Understood how TCP ensures reliable delivery of web traffic through acknowledgments.
- Gained experience using Packet Tracer Simulation Mode to inspect PDU flows.
- Learned to analyze complex PDUs and visualize the traffic step by step.
